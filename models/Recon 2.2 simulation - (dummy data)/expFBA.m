    % pool size is filled. Basically a pool size is the number of parents
    % to be selected. The input arguments to the function
    % tournament_selection are chromosome, pool, tour. The function uses
    % only the information from last two elements in the chromosome vector.
    % The last element has the crowding distance information while the
    % penultimate element has the rank information. Selection is based on
    % rank and if individuals with same rank are encountered, crowding
    % distance is compared. A lower rank and higher crowding distance is
